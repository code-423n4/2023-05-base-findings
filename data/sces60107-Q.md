# Summary

I list 1 low-critical finding:
* (Low)  `StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeERC20` could fail due to insufficient deposits. 

# (Low)  `StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeERC20` could fail due to insufficient deposits. 

## Impact

When using `bridgeERC20()` to send the token. One token should be an OptimismMintable token and the other should not be an OptimismMintable token. It is stated in the known issue.

```text
*There are various 'foot guns' in the bridge which may arise from misconfiguring a token. Examples include:

Having both (or neither of) the local and remote tokens be OptimismMintable.
```

And if the initiate side uses an OptimismMintable token. The finalize side could reverts due to insufficient deposits.


## Proof of Concept

Usually, the deposits should be enough. But if deposits is less than `_amount`. It would revert.

```solidity
    function finalizeBridgeERC20(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) public onlyOtherBridge {
        ...
        } else {
            deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] - _amount;
            IERC20(_localToken).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }

        ..
    }
```




## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check to prevent the revert. If _amount is greater than deposits, construct a message that can let the user take back the funds.
Here is an example:
