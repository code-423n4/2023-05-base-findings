Lack of Function Access Control:
The contract does not enforce access control for critical functions such as upgradeTo, upgradeToAndCall, and changeAdmin. These functions should only be callable by the owner/admin of the contract. Without proper access control, anyone can potentially upgrade the implementation or change the admin, compromising the integrity and security of the system.

Use of Delegatecall:
The _doProxyCall function utilizes the delegatecall opcode, which executes the code of the implementation contract within the context of the proxy contract. While this enables upgradability, it also introduces security risks. Malicious implementation contracts could exploit this behavior to manipulate the state of the proxy contract, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of funds.

Potential Reentrancy Attacks:
The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks when interacting with external contracts during the delegatecall operation. If the implementation contract calls back into the proxy contract before completing the execution, it can reenter the fallback or receive functions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and unauthorized transfers of funds.

Lack of Input Validation:
The contract does not perform sufficient input validation in the upgradeToAndCall function. Malformed or malicious _data could cause unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the implementation contract.

Gas Limit and Out-of-Gas Issues:
The proxy contract forwards all available gas to the implementation contract during the delegatecall operation. If the implementation contract consumes excessive gas or enters an infinite loop, the transaction invoking the proxy contract may run out of gas and fail. Care should be taken to ensure that the implementation contract behaves efficiently and avoids gas-related issues.

Limited Ownership Transfer Security:
The contract allows for changing the owner/admin address through the changeAdmin function. However, there are no additional security measures such as multi-signature requirements or time-based restrictions for ownership transfer. This could lead to unauthorized ownership changes and potential control over the proxy contract.
