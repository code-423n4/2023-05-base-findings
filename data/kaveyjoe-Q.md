Summary:
 proxy contract that allows transparent proxy functionality. However, there are a few potential issues and areas that could be improved.

Bug 1:
In the fallback() and receive() functions, there is a comment saying "Proxy call by default." However, there is no actual logic to handle the proxy call. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially cause the contract to behave incorrectly. It is recommended to remove the comment or implement the necessary logic for proxy call handling.

Bug 2:
The _doProxyCall() function does not properly handle the case when the delegatecall to the implementation contract fails. Currently, it reverts with the error message "Proxy: implementation not initialized." However, this error message is misleading and does not accurately reflect the actual issue. It would be better to provide a more informative error message that indicates the delegatecall failure.

Improvement 1:
The visibility of the upgradeTo() and _setImplementation() functions is set to public virtual. It is generally a good practice to make functions that modify internal state (_setImplementation() in this case) internal, rather than public. This helps prevent unintended access from external contracts and reduces the attack surface of the contract.

Improvement 2:
The visibility of the changeAdmin() and _changeAdmin() functions is set to public virtual. Similar to Improvement 1, it is recommended to make these functions internal unless there is a specific reason for them to be public. This helps enforce proper access control and prevents unauthorized changes to the contract's admin.

Improvement 3:
The admin() and implementation() functions both have the proxyCallIfNotAdmin modifier, which checks if the caller is the admin or address(0). However, it is not necessary to perform this check for read-only functions that do not modify the contract's state. It is recommended to remove the proxyCallIfNotAdmin modifier from these functions to improve gas efficiency.

Other Recommendations:

Add explicit visibility specifiers (e.g., internal, public, external) to function declarations for better readability and to make the code more explicit.
Consider adding additional error handling and validation to ensure that only valid addresses are used for admin and implementation changes.
Add appropriate access control checks, such as a onlyAdmin modifier, to functions that modify the contract's state.
