## Low 1: Funds are stuck in case message relay never succeeds on destination layer
This L2 solution lacks a mechanism to recover funds on the source layer in case a message can never be (not even manually) relayed successfully on the destination layer, see [CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage(...)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/daaf917b201aae021fb10da03ef1262a13e00353/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L291-L413).
In this case, user tokens are stuck in the source layer's [StandardBridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol) contract and ETH is stuck in the source layer's [OptimismPortal.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol) (in case of L1) or [L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol) (in case of L2).
I recommend a mechanism that allows to invalidate a message on the destination layer after a given time-out, this info is then relayed to the source layer and therefore allows the user to recover funds on the source layer.
However, this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug per se, it's just a missing feature and users of this L2 solution are at risk to lose funds without this feature, in case of **user error**.
